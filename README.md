# DMOJ-Solutions
This repository is a collection of all the solutions I have written for competitive programming problems on dmoj.ca
You will be able to see my progress over time while I learn new techniques and concepts that will allow me to solve harder and harder problems. 

My DMOJ profile link is: https://dmoj.ca/user/kerm/ if you would like to take a look :)

If you are unfamiliar with DMOJ, the higher the points (pp), the harder a question is (3pp is very easy, 7pp is moderate, anything above or at 15 is difficult).
